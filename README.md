# "Words from Outer Space" typing game

This is a typing game where players have 1 minute to type words (represented as UFOs) before they reach the end of the play area. Players earn points by completing words and will lose if enough UFOs reach the goal and bring their HP to 0.

### Leaderboard API

Recently I've added a serverless leaderboard to the game (currently requires an account to submit scores). The project for this leaderboard can be found [here](https://github.com/jtaylorsoftware/game-services).
